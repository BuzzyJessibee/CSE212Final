# Introduction
Hi! Welcome to these teaching materials! They're a culmination of all of the knowledge that I've learned throughout the semester, put neatly into documents for the final!

Before you jump into learning, there's one major thing that I mention in each of the modules, that I thought needed it's own section: **Big O notation**.

Now what is Big O notation? It's essentially the performance of a function or algorithm. Mostly we're referring to when the number of objects in our data structure is super super large.

You can visualize Big O notation well with graphs, where x is the number of items(n) and y is the time that it takes to complete the operation.:
```
O(1) -> y = 1

O(n) -> y = x

O(n^2) -> y = x^2

O(log n) -> y = logx
```

(feel free to graph these somewhere like: https://www.desmos.com/calculator)
